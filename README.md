# Using Lagrangian Relaxation on Warehouse Capacity Constraints
It's an inventory control model with warehouse capacity constraints. The objective function minimizes total inventory costs and the decision variables are the number of pieces per order for each product (Q_i). This algorithm first calculates Q_i via the Wilson formula and, afterward, calculates the capacity occupied by this ordering amount. if it obtains an infeasibility, that is, the capacity occupied by this ordering amount outweighs the actual warehouse capacity it will calculate the optimal Q_i by forming its Lagrange function.
